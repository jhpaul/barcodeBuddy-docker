# Barcode Buddy for Grocy

Pass barcodes to Barcode Buddy. If already in [Grocys](https://github.com/grocy/grocy) system, it will consume/add/open the product in Grocy. If an unknown barcode is passed, the product name will be looked up and a corresponding product can be chosen in the Web UI. Tags can be saved - if a new product contains the tag in the name, the product will be already preselected in the drop-down list.

## Prerequisites

Webserver that supports PHP (eg. NGINX, Apache), php-sqlite3, php-curl, ideally a barcode scanner

## Getting Started

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy/wiki), on how to install the program. Installation can be done in a couple of minutes.

### Usage

Barcodes can either manually be added to the programm or the process can be automated by grabbing the input from the scanner.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy/wiki), on how to use the program.
